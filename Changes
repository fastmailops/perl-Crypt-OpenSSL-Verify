0.15-TRIAL
    Special thanks to Wesley Schwengle (WATERKIP) who cleaned up
    a lot of the code, made it readable and fixed a particularly
    hard to track down bug and most of all fixed a lot I had done
    the opposite of correctly.

    Where to start:

    So for a few minutes we were incompatable with less that 5.014
    but Wesley came through with a fix.

    This was a large cleanup refactor by Wesley with me watching and
    learning from the sidelines.  Not a lot of functional changes but
    it does a lot of things differently (correct?) and the documentation
    is much improved.
