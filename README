Crypt::OpenSSL::Verify - OpenSSL Verify certificate verification in XS.

This module provides certificate verification, along the lines of
"openssl verify". While Crypt::OpenSSL::CA can do this, and is
fully-featured, it uses Inline::C, which can present deployment
problems.

It was initially based on the work of Chris Andrew's in 
Crypt::OpenSSL::VerifyX509 but as that module is no longer maintained
this module re-implements that module but attempts to provide more
of the features of the 'openssl verify' command.

In addition it will also include support for passing all certificates 
X509 base64 encoded strings

Major dependency:
 * Crypt::OpenSSL::X509
